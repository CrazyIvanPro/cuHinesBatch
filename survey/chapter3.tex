\chapter{Conclusions}

large-scale brain simulation is not the only
plausible way to approach the problem of building human-like
artificial general intelligence, but it's certainly a sensible candidate approach. So far, the goals of brain simulation projects have
mainly to do with emulating the general properties of brain
subsystems, rather than creating integrated systems (or even
subsystems) that carry out intelligent functions analogously to
the human brain. But once more progress has been made this may
shift, and the line between whole-brain simulations and artificial
intelligence systems may blur. Whether this will be the first
approach to lead to success at human-like AGI remains unclear,
but it is certainly a plausible and promising approach, and
Markram and other simulation researchers have their long-term
sights set specifically in this direction.

The achievements of these benefits is still speculative, and a
great amount of work remains to be done, in brain simulation but
also in other areas such as refinement of the underlying neural
modeling equations, the gathering of neurophysiological data, and
the provision of adequately scalable (and economical) computing
hardware. However we see little doubt that large-scale brain
simulation has a great amount to contribute in the above areas
and others.
